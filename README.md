🎭 Multimodal Deception Detection System

A full-stack AI-powered deception detection system that analyzes video, audio, and text transcription data to detect potential deceptive behavior using multimodal machine learning techniques.

🚀 Overview

This project leverages multimodal data processing to improve deception detection accuracy by combining:

🎥 Video Analysis – Facial expressions, micro-expressions, and behavioral cues

🎙️ Audio Analysis – Voice stress, tone, pitch variation, and speech patterns

📝 Text Transcription Analysis – Linguistic patterns, sentiment, and semantic inconsistencies

By integrating all three modalities, the system enhances prediction reliability compared to single-modality approaches.

🏗️ Architecture

Frontend:

Hosted on Netlify

Handles file uploads (video/audio) and text input

Displays prediction results with confidence scores

Backend:

Deployed on Render

REST API for processing multimodal inputs

ML inference pipeline for video, audio, and text models

Processing Pipeline:

User uploads video/audio or enters text

Server extracts features from:

Video frames

Audio signals

Transcribed speech

Each modality is analyzed independently

Multimodal fusion layer combines predictions

Final deception score is returned
